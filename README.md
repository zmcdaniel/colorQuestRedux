# gemJam

## About
A browser based game built using the Phaser.io framework and HTML5. Exploring a 2D platformer world, the player must locate gems without initiating a Game Over. The game features a timer as well as a score to compare previous attempts. I used the application Tiled to help me in generation a large 2D side scrolling world using an open source, small-sized spritesheet to allow for quick loading times.
